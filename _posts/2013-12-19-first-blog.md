Hello World!! Here is my first post of Jekyll. Thanks to Seeler's template, which looks really cool.  I will also keep updating this template in the future. 

This blog will record some notes of my dally technical study and some of my projects.

It will be available on both <http://qqfish.github.io> and <http://yu-xiao.net>. Hope we will have fun!
